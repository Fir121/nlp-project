      <p>
        Welcome to gradescale.com, a website and online service of BITS Dubai,
        LLC. (“BITS Dubai,” “we,” or “us”). In 2024, gradescale joined BITS
        Dubai, a leading provider of academic integrity and writing assessment
        solutions. Since that time, as we’ve continued to improve and support
        the gradescale product you know and love, we’ve also been settling into
        our new home. This has included improving our policies and practices,
        including but not limited to those around privacy and security. As a
        result, we are adopting a new, companywide privacy policy, and we’ve
        updated our Terms of Service below. If you have any questions or
        concerns about the changes, as always please reach out to us at
        help@gradescale.com. <br />
        This page explains the terms by which you may use the gradescale online
        and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in
        connection with all of BITS Dubai’s gradescale service (the “Service”).
        <br />
        By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read,
        understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Service (the “Terms”)
        and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the
        <span><a href=""> Gradescale Privacy Policy.</a></span> whether or not
        you are a registered user of our Service. If you do not agree, you may
        not use the Service. BITS Dubai reserves the right to make unilateral
        modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes as
        described below. These Terms applies to all visitors, users, and others
        who access the Service (“Users”).<br />
        In the event that BITS Dubai and any School (as defined below) have
        entered into a separate agreement for the Services, such agreement shall
        govern to the extent that any terms directly conflict with the
        provisions of these Terms.<br />
        We have provided headings and summaries in each section for your
        convenience; however, the summaries are not meant to limit the Terms and
        shall not affect or limit in any way the meaning or interpretation of
        the Terms.<br />

        binding contract and create an account. You are responsible for and

        Gradescale Service <br />

        granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable

        Gradescale Accounts<br />
        Your gradescale account gives you access to the services and

        different types of Users.<br />
        You may never use another User’s account without permission. When
        creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete
        information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are
        solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you
        must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong”
        passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case
        letters, numbers and symbols) with your account, and enforce a minimum
        length. You must notify BITS Dubai immediately of any breach of security
        or unauthorized use of your account by emailing informationsecurity@BITS
        Dubai.com. BITS Dubai will not be liable for any losses caused by any
        unauthorized use of your account.<br />

        other similar instructor (a “Teacher”) and use the Service to add or
        invite any students (“Students”) to access and use the Service, you
        represent and warrant that you have the authority to act on behalf of
        your school, university, or other institution (the “School”) and that
        use of the Service, including without limitation adding or inviting
        students to access and use the Service and your use and access of the
        Service in no way violates any agreement between you and the School.

        Schools. If you are a School and use the Service to add or invite any
        Students to access and use the Service, to access Educational Records,
        or in any other way without limitation, you represent and warrant that
        you have the authority to do so. You may control your User profile and

          human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a
          conventional on-line web browser (except that BITS Dubai grants the
          operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders

      </ul>
      <p>

        terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and

        for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by these Terms.

        Service is yours, and you warrant that you have all rights to provide
        it. You agree that others may have access to your content, in accordance
        with your settings and these terms. You cannot post content that is
        criminal, otherwise harmful, or in violation of your school’s policies.
        Some areas of the Service allow Users to post or provide content such as
        profile information, tests and questions, grading rubrics, comments, and
        other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts,

        “User Content”). “User Content” shall also include Teacher feedback,
        educational records, grades, edits, (collectively, “Educational
        Records”) or other Student content. We claim no ownership rights over
        User Content created by you. The User Content you create remains yours;
        however, by providing or sharing User Content through the Service, you
        agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in
        accordance with your settings and these Terms. BITS Dubai has the right
        (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User
        Content that is shared via the Service. <br />You agree not to post User
        Content that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort;</li>
        <li>
          contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful,
          harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory,
          infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights,
          harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise),
          libelous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
          or
        </li>
        <li>
          violates any school or other applicable policy, including those
          related to cheating or ethics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not
        violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any
        Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. If
        you are an instructor or teacher, you represent and warrant that you
        have the right to provide any User Content, including without limitation
        any tests or classroom materials that you provide to the Service. To the
        extent that your User Content contains music, you hereby represent that
        you are the owner of all the copyright rights, including without
        limitation the performance, mechanical, and sound recordings rights,
        with respect to each and every musical composition (including lyrics)
        and sound recording contained in such User Content and have the power to
        grant the license granted below. You understand that publishing your
        User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with
        the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other
        rights organization. <br />
        For the purposes of these Terms, “Intellectual Property Rights” means
        all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights,
        rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights,
        goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as
        may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications
        therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the
        laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction. <br />
        In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant
        the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural
          person in the User Content, if any, to use such person’s name or
          likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms,
          and each such person has released you from any liability that may
          arise in relation to such use.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have obtained and are solely responsible for obtaining all
          consents as may be required by law to post any User Content relating
          to third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your User Content and BITS Dubai’s use thereof as contemplated by
          these Terms and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any
          rights of any third party, including but not limited to any
          Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          BITS Dubai may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under
          these Terms without liability for payment of any guild fees,
          residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective
          bargaining agreement or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other
          information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BITS Dubai takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User
        Content that you or any other User or third party posts, sends, or
        otherwise makes available over the Service. You shall be solely
        responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting,
        publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on the
        Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for
        your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You
        understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is
        inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise
        unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that BITS Dubai shall not be
        liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of or relating to
        any User Content. <br />
        3. User Content License Grant <br />
        Summary: You grant us license to use your content; we will only use it
        on an aggregated, non-identifiable basis, or in accordance with your
        settings. <br />
        By posting or otherwise making available any User Content on or through
        the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you
        have all rights necessary to grant and hereby grant to BITS Dubai a
        royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable,
        non-exclusive, worldwide license, subject to the restrictions set forth
        below to reproduce, modify, publish, publicly display, make derivative
        works and otherwise use such User Content and your name, voice, and/or
        likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in
        any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed,
        for use in connection with the Service and BITS Dubai’s (and its
        successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for
        promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative
        works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, BITS Dubai will only use your User
        Content as you provide in your settings page. <br />
        If you are a Student, you agree that BITS Dubai may make your User
        Content available to your Teacher(s) and School(s), for the purposes of
        improving the BITS Dubai services only and at all times on a
        confidential basis, may use your Educational Records solely on an
        aggregated, de-identified basis and will not share such information with
        third parties. <br />
        If you are a Teacher or School, you agree that BITS Dubai may (i) make
        specific Educational Records available to the applicable Student, and
        (ii) for the purposes of improving the BITS Dubai services only and at
        all times on a confidential basis, otherwise use your Educational
        Records on an aggregated, de-identified basis and will not share such
        information with third parties. <br />
        4. Our Proprietary Rights <br />
        Summary: We own the Service, and have provided some of our own content,
        which you agree not to treat as yours. We would love to hear your
        feedback and ideas, and possibly incorporate them, but cannot compensate
        you for them. <br />
        Except for your User Content, the Service and all materials therein or
        transferred thereby, including, without limitation, software, images,
        text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents, trademarks, service
        marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music, and User Content
        belonging to other Users (the “gradescale Content”), and all
        Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property
        of BITS Dubai and its licensors (including other Users who post User
        Content to the Service). Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing
        in these Terms shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such
        Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent,
        modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display,
        publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from

        that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction
        and will not place BITS Dubai under any fiduciary or other obligation,
        and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation
        to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or
        otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your
        submission, BITS Dubai does not waive any rights to use similar or
        related ideas previously known to BITS Dubai, or developed by its
        employees, or obtained from sources other than you. <br />
        5. BITS Dubai Property <br />
        Summary: We own some content on the Service, and have ultimate authority
        over its presence, with no liability of any kind. <br />

        owned by you (“BITS Dubai Property”). You understand and agree that
        regardless of terminology used, BITS Dubai Property represents a limited
        license right governed solely by the terms of these Terms and available
        for distribution at BITS Dubai’s sole discretion. You acknowledge that
        you do not own the account you use to access the Service, nor do you

        and that BITS Dubai will have no liability to you based on its exercise
        of such right. All data on BITS Dubai’s gradescale servers are subject
        to deletion, alteration or transfer. <br />

        PARTY, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DATA, ACCOUNT HISTORY AND
        ACCOUNT CONTENT RESIDING ON BITS Dubai’S gradescale SERVERS, MAY BE
        DELETED, ALTERED, MOVED OR TRANSFERRED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON IN
        BITS Dubai’S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITH NO
        LIABILITY OF ANY KIND. BITS Dubai DOES NOT PROVIDE OR GUARANTEE, AND
        EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY VALUE, CASH OR OTHERWISE, ATTRIBUTED TO ANY
        DATA RESIDING ON BITS Dubai’S gradescale SERVERS. <br />
        6. Privacy <br />
        Summary: We know privacy and security are paramount. We have a

        , which you should read. In brief: we use cookies, do not allow
        third-party advertising based on user activity, fully comply with FERPA,
        and use data to improve our Service.
        <br />
        Student Data <br />
        If you are a Teacher or School that will be providing BITS Dubai access
        to Student Data (as defined below) via the gradescale service, you
        authorize BITS Dubai to access your student information systems (“SIS”)
        or receive Student Data or other information via SIS, Secure File
        Transfer Protocol (“SFTP”), or other secure transfer method for the
        purpose of providing the Service. “Student Data” is any information (in
        any format) that is directly related to an identifiable current or
        former student that is maintained by a school, school district, or
        related entity or organization, or by us. Student Data may include
        “educational records” as defined in the Family Educational Rights and
        Privacy Act (“FERPA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(g). <br />
        Confidentiality <br />
        BITS Dubai agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to share
        it with third parties other than as described in these Terms, including
        the gradescale Privacy Policy, available at gradescale.com/privacy.
        <br />
        BITS Dubai Access <br />
        You authorize BITS Dubai to access and process Student Data solely for
        the purposes of providing the Service, as an outsourced institutional
        function pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1). As between BITS
        Dubai and School or Teacher, School or Teacher owns right, title, and

        (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY
        AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR
        CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SERVICE; (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES,
        TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR
        SERVICE BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT
        OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT
        POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE

        DAMAGES, LOSSES OR COSTS IN AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO
        BITS Dubai HEREUNDER OR $100.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. <br />
        THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED
        LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
        ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF BITS Dubai HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
        OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE
        FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. <br />
        SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU. THESE TERMS GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY
        ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE DISCLAIMERS,
        EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT
        APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. <br />
        BITS Dubai makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or
        available for use outside the United Arab Emirates. Those who access or
        use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and
        are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United Arab
        Emirates and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to
        export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a
        resident of a country embargoed by the United Arab Emirates, or are a
        foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United Arab Emirates
        government. <br />
        15. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver
        <br />
        Summary: We are based in the UAE, and any disputes will be arbitrated
        here. All claims must be brought in the party’s individual capacity.
        <br />
        Governing Law. <br />
        This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        laws of the State of UAE, without regard to its conflict of laws
        principles. Each party hereby expressly and irrevocably consents to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San
        Francisco County, UAE in connection with any action to enforce the
        provisions of this Agreement, to recover damages or other relief under
        this Agreement, or otherwise arising under or by reason of this
        Agreement. <br />
        Arbitration <br />
        READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE
        THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM
        BITS Dubai. For any dispute with BITS Dubai, you agree to first contact
        us at legal@BITS Dubai.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us
        informally. In the unlikely event that BITS Dubai has not been able to
        resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree
        to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for
        injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of
        or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or
        alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration
        by JAMS, under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in
        effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at
        www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco
        County, UAE, unless you and BITS Dubai agree otherwise. If you are using
        the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for
        paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance
        with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include
        costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs
        for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the
        Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a
        fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and
        successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by
        the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable
        attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other
        witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent
        jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not
        absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute
        resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
        may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this
        Section shall be deemed as preventing BITS Dubai from seeking injunctive
        or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the
        actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our
        data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.
        <br />
        Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. <br />
        WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY
        HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER
        PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL
        CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
        ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER
        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION,
        AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE
        THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS,
        YOU AND BITS Dubai ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO
        PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY
        GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND. <br />
        16. General <br />
        Summary: We may notify you by emailing you or by posting a notification
        on our website. These terms and our Privacy Policy are the complete
        agreement between us, unless we have additional agreements as described
        below. <br />
        Assignment <br />
        These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
        transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by BITS Dubai
        without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation
        hereof shall be null and void. <br />
        Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms <br />
        BITS Dubai may provide notifications, whether such notifications are
        required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes,
        to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting
        of such notice on our website, as determined by BITS Dubai in our sole
        discretion. BITS Dubai reserves the right to determine the form and
        means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt
        out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms. BITS
        Dubai is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network
        provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address
        you provide us. BITS Dubai may, in its sole discretion, modify or update
        these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page
        periodically. When we change these Terms in a material manner, we will
        update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your
        continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your
        acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these
        terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to
        access) the Service. <br />
        Entire Agreement/Severability <br />
        These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements
        you may enter into with BITS Dubai in connection with the Service, shall
        constitute the entire agreement between you and BITS Dubai concerning
        the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a
        court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall
        not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms,
        which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of
        unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the
        entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable. <br />
        No Waiver <br />
        No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or
        continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and BITS Dubai’s
        failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not
        constitute a waiver of such right or provision. <br />
