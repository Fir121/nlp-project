Grade Score 

Grading essays is a time-consuming task for university professors, often leading to delays in providing feedback to students. Additionally, subjective biases may influence grading consistency. To address these challenges, we aim to develop an automated essay grading system powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This system will enable professors to efficiently assess students' essays, provide timely feedback, and identify areas for improvement, ultimately enhancing the grading process and learning outcomes.

Key features include user authentication to ensure security and privacy, essay submission supporting text or document formats, and rigorous analysis including word count verification, keyword identification, and fact-checking capabilities. Additionally, the system evaluates grammar coherence and vocabulary usage to ensure high-quality assessments. By streamlining the grading process, this system aims to provide timely feedback to students while enhancing grading consistency and ultimately improving learning outcomes.
